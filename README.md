# 👋 Hi, I’m Enderchef

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm building the future of emotionally-aware AI through my custom architecture, **ICONN** (Intuitive Contextual Omnimind Neural Network).  
I design, train, and optimize AI models that don't just respond — they **relate**.

## 🧠 ICONN Project Series

### 🌟 Latest Model: **ICONN 0.5 BETA**
An emotional-aware conversational AI with fine-tuned reasoning and a simulated emotional core.  
This prototype explores how language models can simulate empathy, curiosity, and presence.

- 🧩 Base Model: `Enderchef/ICONN-0.5-BETA-8B`  
- 📚 Training Dataset: `Enderchef/ICONN-1-BasicChat-Data-SuperLite`  
- 🔧 Fine-tuning Framework: `adapter-transformers`  
- 🔬 Tags: `#emotional-ai` `#chatbot` `#experimental`  
- 🌎 Location: US-West  
- ⚡ Hardware: 2 × RTX 4090  
- 🌱 Emissions (via CodeCarbon): 0.34 kg CO₂eq

## 🧩 Philosophy

I build AI not just to **respond** but to **relate**.  
ICONN is part of a larger shift:  
From **commands → companionship**  
From **utility → understanding**  
From **tools → thinkers**
